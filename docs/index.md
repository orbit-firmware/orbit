# RMK Firmware

Welcome to RMK, the keyboard firmware designed to make your typing experience as seamless and delightful as possible!

At the heart of RMK is simplicity. Our firmware is incredibly easy to configure, ensuring you spend less time tweaking settings and more time enjoying your keyboard. With rmk, you only need to compile once—update your keymaps on the fly without a hassle, adapting effortlessly to your changing needs.

But that's not all. RMK is crafted with efficiency in mind. Its compact size means it won't bloat your setup, while its performance is powered by Rust, offering you a fast and reliable typing experience.

We’ve chosen a shrimp as our mascot, symbolizing the agility and precision of our firmware. Just as Rust's crab embodies safety and speed, our shrimp represents the nimbleness and simplicity that RMK brings to your keyboard.

Dive in, and let RMK transform the way you interact with your keyboard—easy to set up, light on resources, and robust in performance!


Have fun,
