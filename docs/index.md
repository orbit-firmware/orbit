The keyboard firmware designed to be delightful!

The main motivation for creating yet another keyboard firmware was to eliminate many of the friction and pain points that users might encounter with other firmwares.

You only need two files to get you up and running:
- `keyboard.toml` -> Describes your keyboard.
- `keymap.orbit` -> Your keymap file.

In many cases, the keyboard.toml file is not even needed, as the community provides a wealth of predefined keyboards ready for use.

It supports `Hall-Effect` switches out of the box.  
All behaviors are designed to work seamlessly together.  
Keymaps can be placed directly on the keyboard's flash drive,  
so thereâ€™s no need to recompile.

Dive in, and let orbit transform the way you interact with your keyboard!

Easy to set up, light on resources, and robust in performance!
