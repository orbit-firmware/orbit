ðŸ“– [Docs](https://rmk-firmware.github.io/rmk)


RMK is a rust keyboard firmware built for ease.  
The main selling pints are:
  1. that you can configure your keyboard trough the keyboards flash drive.
  2. that its fast and reliable since its built on rust.
  3. that adding your own keyboard is just a single config file.
  4. that it supports a lot of chipsets trough [embassy](https://github.com/embassy-rs/embassy)


Here is an example keymap:
