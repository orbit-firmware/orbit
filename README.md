# ![logo](https://github.com/rmk-firmware/rmk/blob/master/docs/public/logo-64x64.png?raw=true) RMK Firmware

RMK is a rust keyboard firmware built for ease.  
The main selling points are:
  - You can configure your keyboard directly through the keyboard's flash drive.
  - Itâ€™s fast and reliable, as it's built in Rust.
  - Adding your own keyboard is as simple as creating a single configuration file.
  - It supports a wide variety of chipsets through [embassy](https://github.com/embassy-rs/embassy).
    - **Hardware Abstraction Layers** - HALs implement safe, idiomatic Rust APIs to use the hardware capabilities, so raw register manipulation is not needed. The Embassy project maintains HALs for select hardware, but you can still use HALs from other projects with Embassy.
      - <a href="https://docs.embassy.dev/embassy-stm32/">embassy-stm32</a>, for all STM32 microcontroller families.
      - <a href="https://docs.embassy.dev/embassy-nrf/">embassy-nrf</a>, for the Nordic Semiconductor nRF52, nRF53, nRF91 series.
      - <a href="https://docs.embassy.dev/embassy-rp/">embassy-rp</a>, for the Raspberry Pi RP2040 microcontroller.
      - <a href="https://github.com/esp-rs">esp-rs</a>, for the Espressif Systems ESP32 series of chips.
        - Embassy HAL support for Espressif chips is being developed in the [esp-rs/esp-hal](https://github.com/esp-rs/esp-hal) repository.
        - Async WiFi, Bluetooth and ESP-NOW is being developed in the [esp-rs/esp-wifi](https://github.com/esp-rs/esp-wifi) repository.
      - <a href="https://github.com/ch32-rs/ch32-hal">ch32-hal</a>, for the WCH 32-bit RISC-V(CH32V) series of chips.
