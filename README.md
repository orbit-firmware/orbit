Orbit is a rust keyboard firmware built for ease.  
The main selling points are:
  - You can configure your keyboard directly through the keyboard's flash drive.
  - Itâ€™s fast and reliable, as it's built in Rust.
  - Adding your own keyboard is as simple as creating a single configuration file.
  - It supports a wide variety of chipsets through [embassy](https://github.com/embassy-rs/embassy).
    - all of the STM32 family, the nRF52, nRF53, nRF91, Raspberry Pi RP2040, ESP32 and the WCH 32-bit RISC-V(CH32V) series.


Here is an example keymap:
