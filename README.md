Orbit is a `rust keyboard firmware` built for ease.  
  
Its main selling points are:
  - You can configure your keyboard directly through the keyboard's flash drive.
  - Itâ€™s fast and reliable, as it's built in Rust.
  - Adding your own keyboard is as simple as creating a single configuration file.
  - It supports a wide variety of chipsets through [embassy](https://github.com/embassy-rs/embassy).
    - All of the `STM32` family
    - The `nRF52`, `nRF53` and `nRF91`
    - Raspberry Pi `RP2040`
    - The `ESP32` and the WCH 32-bit RISC-V(CH32V) series.
