# ![logo](https://github.com/rmk-firmware/rmk/blob/master/docs/public/logo-64x64.png?raw=true) RMK Firmware

RMK is a rust keyboard firmware built for ease.  
The main selling points are:
  - You can configure your keyboard directly through the keyboard's flash drive.
  - Itâ€™s fast and reliable, as it's built in Rust.
  - Adding your own keyboard is as simple as creating a single configuration file.
  - It supports a wide variety of chipsets through [embassy](https://github.com/embassy-rs/embassy).

Here is an example keymap:
